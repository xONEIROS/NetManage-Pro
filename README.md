---

## üìã Main Menu Options

### 1. **Generate IPv6/IPv4 Addresses**  
   - **Description**: Generates random IPv6 or IPv4 addresses based on the selected version.
   - **Usage**:  
     - Select whether to generate IPv4 or IPv6 addresses.
     - Enter the number of addresses you want to generate.
     - If IPv6, enter the prefix (e.g., `2001:db8::/64`).
   - **Example**:  

```
IPv4 or IPv6 (v4/v6)? v6
Enter IPv6 prefix (e.g., 2001:db8::/64): 2001:db8::/64
Enter the number of addresses to generate: 5
```

### 2. **Generate EUI-64 IPv6 Addresses**  
   - **Description**: Generates IPv6 addresses based on the EUI-64 format (using MAC addresses).
   - **Usage**:  
     - Enter the MAC address and IPv6 prefix.
     - The tool will generate the corresponding EUI-64 IPv6 address.
   - **Example**:  
```
Enter MAC address (e.g., 00:1A:2B:3C:4D:5E): 00:1A:2B:3C:4D:5E
Enter IPv6 prefix (e.g., 2001:db8::/64): 2001:db8::/64
```

### 3. **Save Addresses (Text, JSON, CSV)**  
   - **Description**: Saves the generated addresses in a format of your choice (text, JSON, or CSV).
   - **Usage**:  
     - After generating addresses, select the file format and specify the filename.
   - **Example**:  
```
Enter filename to save: my_ipv6_addresses
Choose format (text/json/csv): json
```

### 4. **Execute SSH Command**  
   - **Description**: Runs a command on a remote server over SSH.
   - **Usage**:  
     - Enter the remote server‚Äôs details (IP, username, password) and the command to be executed.
   - **Example**:  
```
Enter SSH host: 192.168.1.100
Enter SSH username: admin
